1: finding 1st and last digits/numbers.  Both complete

2:  Counting marbles/fewest marbles in game:  Both complete

8:  1st part following path complete.  The second part, following multiple paths: find the length of each cycle and then figure out when they will overlap.  The number is going to be huge.  2nd part, somehow all cycles were exact multiples of the length of the directions list, which made the problem simplify into a LCM problem at the end.

9

10: can follow the pipe and find length for part 1, TODO part to, how to determine the inside?
11: 
12: part 1 works but is a bit brute force trying all combos of ?'s with the correct number of # and . .  Part two has code but would take too long to ever complete.
13: part 1 complete finding lines of reflection, part 2 TODO

14: part 1 rolling objects complete, part 2 also complete, found cycle length and then used that as a multiple to find the anser.

16:  

17:  Full pathfinding needed, but with added condition of no more than 3 in a row.

18: Directions but same issue as day 10 part 2, how to determine inside from outside.
